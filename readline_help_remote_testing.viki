I have a method to using readline helping remote testing.

It is very slow when do remote testing. I managed to use
readline saving some time.

This is applied in those situations:
-some commands will be inputed twices-

* if there is no rebooting between those two run
We can save the first input as a macro, just do:
ctrl-x ( <commands> ctrl-x )

NOTE: in readline, it says if prefix a numeric argument, it will append
the new input to the old definition. But it will repeat the old define first...
this is bad ...

* if there will be a rebooting between those two runs:
We can record those commands into the .inputrc.

#Quote <<----
first, run those cmmands.
then, use 'fc -ln|sed -e 's/^[[:space:]]*//' to list out them.
then, use bind '"\C-xm1": "<copy previous listed commands here, reserve the newline>"'
then, use bind -s >> ~/.inputrc to save those marcos.
