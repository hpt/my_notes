* question about /.\%>'s.*\%<'e..

#Quote <<----
/.\%>'s.*\%<'e..
----

will match 
#Quote <<----
world

IM hello

VIM
----
without the empty lines

but 
#Quote <<----
\%'s\_.\{-}\%'e
----

will match this with the empty lines. I don't understand why there is can have 'holes' in a pattern matching?
Notes: the mark 's' at the 'w' and mark 'e' at the 'o'.
